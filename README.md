# Just a simple game

I wanted to use this project to do all the simple hello world type stuff in godot.  Starting with the free code camp [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8lMTwSRoRg&t=1323s) I am doing some simple game playing around with the hope to make an actual game someday.

Not guarenteed to work or anything, buyer beware.
